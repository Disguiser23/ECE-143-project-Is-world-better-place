# ECE143 Project: Is the world going to be a better place? (Team 23)
This project was motivated by the fact that during the 2020 global pandemic, we all needed some encouragement. We wanted to analyze if the world is actually improving, even though we are constantly exposed to more bad than good  news.

## How to run the code
Within each data, there's a "cleaned" subdirectory that stores the data that will be used.

However, we can re-do the cleaning process by running different python files for each category.

Directly run main.ipynb. It will call the python files for three categories respectively. 

To generate the world map graph, run world_overall.py.

All outputs are stored into ./output_images directory.
